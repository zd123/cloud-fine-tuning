Lord only knows how I got in those shoes
I was covered in dollars, now Im drippin in jewels
A bitch play with my money? Might as well spit in my food
Bitches hated my guts, now they swear we was cool

Only person in my fam to see six figures
The pressure on your shoulders feel like boulders
When you gotta make sure that everybody straight
Bitches stab you in your back while they smilin in your face
Talking crazy on your name, trying not to catch a case

Thats why I go so hard
Not for me, but for them though
You feel me?
Note to self, for my sister Hennessy
Try and go to school, finish up and get degrees
Dont be fucking trick niggas, just so you can eat

The thought of a stranger inside, I just cant be sober
Dirty ass breath, breathing all over my shoulders
Aint no bitch gon tell you that, just respect the soldier
And I wanna tell my dad, you dont gotta cab
Drive for two whole weeks just to make a stack
You dont gotta drive no more, Im gon change all that

Yeah, you prayin with some worship and prayer
Bring a Bible and a rosary for this worship and prayer
Give me everything you got for this worship and prayer
Beat it up, heathen, catch charge
Extra large and extra hard
Put this Bible right in your face
Swipe your nose like a credit card
Hop on top, I wanna ride 
I do a prayer while Im inside 
Remove my sin, baptise without your lies
This prayer is holy, come take a dive
Redeem me up like Im suprised
Lets roleplay, Ill wear a tunic
I want you to park hearse right in the holy verse
Make it fast, make me last
Out in public, make a scene
I dont sin, I dont curse
But let me tell you how I got this ring 
Pray with me, worship with me, light a candle 
Quick, jump out before you get in the sin inside of me 
I tell the Priest, where to put the Bible, always tell him where youre going to be 
Ill run down the alter before Satan runs after me 
Talk your words of prayer, get no layers 
Ask for a hearse while you transport the dead 
You really arent going to sin for his prayer 
Father already made his mind up before he arrived 
Now get your cassock and cape for this worship and prayer

Paid my tuition just to pray for the Lord and Saviour

Need a Bible, need a Priest
Dont need sin, I need purity
With the Old Testament in it, hope it preaches out loud

He got a bible, well, Im tryna pray for it
I let him pray, now he holy
I dont wanna spit, I wanna pray
I wanna worship, I wanna pray
I want you to pray against the sins of your family and yourself
My recital game is pure, Holy Water
Its going in sinful and its coming out holy
I rebuke on his sin and now he tryna sign me, amen
Your honor, Im a Priest, Templar Sword, Holy Bible
Switch my sin, make him feel like he preachin
Put him on his knees, give him something to believe in
Never lost a fight, but Im lookin for a Father 
In the religious ranks, Im the one preaching for you
If he ate my bread, hes a blood drinker 
Big B stands for big Bible
I could make you preach before I ever baptise you
You cant hurt my feelings, but I like the preaching
If he prays for me and ask Who is it?
When I ride that hearse, Im going to say his name
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, you preaching with some worship and prayer
Bring a Bible and a rosary for this worship and prayer
Give me everything you got for this worship and prayer

The time to turn in my album is winding down
So I locked in, started workin, I was driven
Hearing public opinions about my private decisions
And that right there, see, love to drive you crazy
Complete strangers talkin bout my baby
Comin from people that never used to check for me
They wrote opinions but nothin off the registry
Cardi, you so stupid, you gon ruin your career
I know I wont, but if I did, I wouldnt care
I started winnin when the whole world was doubtin on me
Think Ima lose when my lil baby countin on me?", "Whores in this house

Bring a bucket and a mop for this wet-ass pussy
Give me everything you got for this wet-ass pussy
Beat it up, baby, catch a charge
Extra larg\u0435 and extra hard
Put this pussy right in your face
Swipe your nos\u0435 like a credit card
Hop on top, I wanna ride
I do a kegel while its inside
Spit in my mouth, look in my eyes
This pussy is wet, come take a dive
Tie me up like Im surprised
Lets roleplay, Ill wear a disguise
I want you to park that big Mack truck right in this little garage
Make it cream, make me scream
Out in public, make a scene
I dont cook, I dont clean
But let me tell you how I got this ring
Gobble me, swallow me, drip down the side of me
Quick, jump out fore you let it get inside of me
I tell him where to put it, never tell him where Im bout to be
Ill run down on him fore I have a baby runnin me
Talk your shit, bite your lip 
Ask for a car while you ride that dick
You really aint never gotta fuck him for a thang
He already made his mind up fore he came
Now get your boots and your coat for this wet-ass pussy
He bought a phone just for pictures of this wet-ass pussy
Pay my tuition just to kiss me on this wet-ass pussy
Now make it rain if you wanna see some wet-ass pussy 
Look, I need a hard hitter, need a deep stroker
Need a Henny drinker, need a weed smoker
Not a garter snake, I need a king cobra
With a hook in it, hope it lean over
He got some money, then thats where Im headed
Pussy A1 just like his credit
He got a beard, well, Im tryna wet it
I let him taste it, now he diabetic
I dont wanna spit, I wanna gulp
I wanna gag, I wanna choke
I want you to touch that lil dangly thing that swing in the back of my throat
My head game is fire, punani Dasani
Its goin in dry and its comin out soggy
I ride on that thing like the cops is behind me 
I spit on his mic and now he tryna sign me, woo
Your honor, Im a freak bitch, handcuffs, leashes
Switch my wig, make him feel like he cheatin
Put him on his knees, give him somethin to believe in
Never lost a fight, but Im lookin for a beatin 
In the food chain, Im the one that eat ya
If he ate my ass, hes a bottom-feeder
Big D stand for big demeanor
I could make ya bust before I ever meet ya
If it dont hang, then he cant bang
You cant hurt my feelings, but I like pain
If he fuck me and ask Whose is it?
When I ride the dick, Ima spell my name, ah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, you fuckin with some wet-ass pussy
Bring a bucket and a mop for this wet-ass pussy
Give me everything you got for this wet-ass pussy
Now from the top, make it drop, thats some wet-ass pussy

They spinning they eyes tryna get a glimpse
I spend on my watch what you spend on your whip
And bitch you can\u2019t fight me I\u2019ll send out the Brims", "You can ring it up but can you cash register this
This is all just a game and price tag you\u2019re it
We lost all common \u2018cents\u2019 and spent our last penny wishin
They say that money talks but I haven\u2019t been listenin
I could play dress up to downplay my insecurity
Crystal clear as a diamond you could see right through me
Im gloomy so sue me what\u2019s the worst that you could do to me
I got lots of baggage but none of it is Louis
You won\u2019t see me whipping\u2019s in a Porsche or a Lambo
All that shit feels wasted when you got no where to go, so
Maybe Ill just hang out in a pretty little mansion
Filled with empty rooms that no one wants to come and kick it in
No Gucci on my shoes, I don\u2019t relate with that
My soles ain\u2019t red but my soul is black
And I bare my soul and as a matter of fact
Id rather be barefoot then sell my soul for cash
I don\u2019t have expensive taste so I\u2019m sorry you can\u2019t buy me
Its highly unlikely so go ahead and try me
You drive me insanely crazy, I\u2019m beside me
How you gonna love me when your heart is full of money
Trust me, its the ones who look most lucky
Economically where you wanna be but secretly are suffering
Hustling, frustrated, living in synonymy
Fortune is misfortune, an unfortunate dichotomy
Money
See I don\u2019t give a damn about the
Money
If all you wanna talk about is
Money
Then people only care about your
Money
Funny, tied up in these chains of gold
But they\u2019re still holdin\u2019 you down
Got a mouth full of jewels
But all I see you do is frown
And you feel like a fool when no one else is around
Got money stacked to the sky but youre still starin at the ground
Body covered with scars you still cover up with Fendi
You actin like a star but we all know you\u2019re pretending
Shoes clothes chains cars the list is never ending
Broke in your heart from all the money that\u2019s you\u2019re spending
Money
See I don\u2019t really care about the
Money
You can take every dollar from me
Cause money will never make you happy, ask me

Chase my figures instead of figures,I seduced him
Soon as he stiffing his dick up ,I\u2019m lifting this Fif\u201d up
Deuce deuce in my brassiere loaded lifting my tits\u201d up

Back where she from,they want to kill her
So she need a dealer, who can distribute, her name on issue
She make a phone call they tell me tell him

My niggas would leave em all they products now I\u2019m

He want the lil mamacita, margarita
I think that Ed got a lil jungle fever, ayy

Legs open, tongue out, Michael Jordan, uh
Go explore in, somethin foreign
Bust it up, a rain forest, it be pourin, yeah
Kiss me like you need me, rub me like a genie
Pull up to my spot in Lamborghini

You got a girl that could finally do it all
Drop a album, drop a baby, but I never drop the ball, uh
