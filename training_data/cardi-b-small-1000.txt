Gave you TLC, you wanna creep and shit
Poured out my whole heart to a piece of shit
Man, I thought you wouldve learned your lesson
Bout likin pictures, not returnin texts
I guess its fine, man, I get the message
You still stutter after certain questions
You keep in contact with certain exes
Do you, though, trust me, nigga, its cool, though
Said that you was workin, but you out here chasin culo
And putas, chillin poolside, livin two lives
I couldve did what you did to me to you a few times
But if I did decide to slide, find a nigga
Fuck him, suck his dick, you wouldve been pissed
But thats not my M.O., Im not that type of bitch
And karma for you is gon be who you end up with
You make me sick, nigga
The only man, baby, I adore
I gave you everything, whats mine is yours
I want you to live your life of course
But I hope you get what you dyin for
Be careful with me, do you know what you doin?
Whose feelings that youre hurtin and bruisin?
You gon gain the whole world
But is it worth the girl that youre losin?
Be careful with me
Yeah, its not a threat, its a warnin
Be careful with me
Yeah, my heart is like a package with a fragile label on it
Be careful with me
Care for me, care for me

Guess you actin out now, you got an audience
Tell me where your mind is, drop a pin, whats the coordinates?
You might have a fortune, but you lose me, you still gon be misfortunate, nigga
Tell me, this lust got you this fucked up in the head
You want some random bitch up in your bed?
She dont even know your middle name, watch her cause she might steal your chain
You dont want someone who loves you instead? I guess not though
Its blatant disrespect, you nothin like the nigga I met
Talk to me crazy and you quick to forget
You even got me trippin, you got me lookin in the mirror different
Thinkin Im flawed because you inconsistent
Between a rock and a hard place, the mud and the dirt
Its gon hurt me to hate you, but lovin yous worse
It all stops so abrupt, we started switchin it up
Teach me to be like you so I can not give a fuck
Free to mess with someone else, I wish these feelings could melt
